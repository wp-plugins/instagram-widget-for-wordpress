== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why do I need a User_ID or Access Token? =

Instagram needs to know what user you are and the access token is manditory for Instagram to prove you have taken the right steps to view your gallery.

= Why do I need to visit http://instagram.davidmregister.com to get my User_ID and access token? =

The only way to get this information is through Instagram's API. I have created a simple portal to make it easy for users to get this information.
